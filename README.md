### Trade Coffee

## Webscraping Project

Trade Coffee is a home delivery service that connects consumers to over 50 small craft coffee roasters from all over America. I wanted to explore what Trade Coffee has to offer to consumers both novices and aficionados to the world of craft and specialty coffee. I was curious about what sort of products they had to offer and how consumers can narrow down their choices when picking a bag of coffee.
